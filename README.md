This Node.js based command-line application takes in user input and generates a logo in an .svg format. It is made for the cheapo freelance web developer who doesnt want to pay a graphic designer for simple logos. Along with node.js, this application uses inquirer, tinycolor2, fs, and jest to run.

Example of a generated svg logo:

<img src="./assets/images/Logo.svg" alt="example of the generated logo" style="width: 300px;">
